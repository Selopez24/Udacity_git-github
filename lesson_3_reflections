When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When it isn't a big change or there is not access to the local repository at a particular moment. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
It is better in order to have control of when we want to sync the repositories.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork and clone a repository is the same, the difference is where it happens, that is, in Github or local in a machine. 
Branches are different versions of a repository wich can be used to work in features indenpendently and then merge the files.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
It helps to keep track of that state as a branch and work on it offline.
